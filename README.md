*_A Small Game My Team at School Created for our CS Year-end Project_*

Yeah, I am serious. THIS IS A GAME! 

But wait... why is this not full of good graphics and images?? This is a game we created from scratch and whatever we had learnt at school. So instead of flying to expert-sort of levels of code, we decided we stay beneath the roof (except that we have integrated classes & thus OOP concept into the code, which is actually out of syllabus for us). 

I began making this game just when my teacher told us of this year-end project. I showed it to my friends and they we're very positive about it. I had first planned to make a game where the player fights with the computer and we had some elaborate sort of setups for it. But as time passed, we realized the difficulty in the production and decided we create a backup plan, a two-player single system game. This backup plan is what I have posted in this repo. The aforementioned version of it (not the two-player one) is posted in another repo of mine in another name (March of the Final Four - a not-so-nice name for a game) and is still under production (I may complete it at some time undefined).

I guess you all can understand what purpose each file serves in the code from the way I named them. 

## Requirements:
* Python 3.X
* ` mysql-connector` package
* Latest MySQL (I'm not sure if updations will affect the working; in case errors come up, please open an issue.)

## Credits
* My teammates, Paul Ranjith and Raamsaran Samith
* My Class Teacher, Mrs Jeena Seby, who is also my computer science teacher
* Sinan Islekdemir, a GitHub user and a person whom I refer to frequently regarding code and stuff
* user253751 aka immibis on Stack Exchange (I found him for reference on AI SE and yeah, he advised me well, but seems like I couldn't put things running well.... still the person helped me change my perception about perceptrons)

## Updates
* 31/8/2022 : Added SQL connectivity for saving data.
